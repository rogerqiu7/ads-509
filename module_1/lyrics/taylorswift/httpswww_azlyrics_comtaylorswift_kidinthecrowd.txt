Kid In The Crowd

Little girl, she looks around She's standing in the open ground Looks up at the girl alone Singing through the microphone Girl gives girl a little smile And just one wink that could have run a mile But life is full of empty days But the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday" I remember the eyes Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size And realizing is crying out loud For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd Girl on stage holds her hand Backed up by a country band Looking down with eyes of grace Looked upon that young girl's face And when she smiled at that 8 year old Endless thoughts that can never be told Wiped away those empty days And the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday" I remember the eyes Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size And realizing is crying out loud For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd Answered why's are like moonlit skies And loving eyes are like fireflies One of these, they really can be But that little girl, that little girl was me I remember the time I was a kid in the crowd With a dream in my eyes Realizing is crying out loud There was a kid on stage, I was a kid in the crowd I'm still the kid in the crowd

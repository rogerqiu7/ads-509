Fire

Asking you questions is like asking for lies "Won't happen no more," yeah, I've heard that before Running 'round in circles isn't my game I tried to make it work but I end up getting burned By the fire Leading on life with a tear in my eye And I know Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn To try to put out your fire Giving you answers to my trivial heart It's hard to break the chains That I can't pull apart Running 'round in circles ain't nobody's game I tried to make it work but I keep on getting hurt By the fire Leading on life with a tear in my eye And I know Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn To try to put out your fire Your flames, oh they're putting me out The smoke, can't see my way out The heat, the heartaches The fog, the blindness The eyes of cries and shattered lies Trying to put out your fire Leading on life with a tear in my eye And I know Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn To try to put out your fire Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn To try to put out your fire

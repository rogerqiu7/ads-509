True Believer

I wasn't always the brightest, until I learned how to dance You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never gave me a chance I might not been the tallest, until I learned how to jump You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never say I'm the one If I could make you, make you fall in love with me If I could make you, make you fall in love Wish I could make you, make you make you fall in love Maybe love will come around if you want it enough Maybe love will come around if you want it enough Woah-oh-oh, yeah! Love will come around Maybe love will come around, for us I wasn't always the bravest, they say you only live once So, you got me thinking, I'm so glad I found you Life's what you make it so here it comes, it goes If I could make you, make you fall in love with me If I could make you, make you fall in love Wish I could make you, make you fall in love Maybe love will come around if you want it enough Maybe love will come around if you want it enough If you're a true believer If you're a true believer Love will come around Lo-lo-love will come around, for us

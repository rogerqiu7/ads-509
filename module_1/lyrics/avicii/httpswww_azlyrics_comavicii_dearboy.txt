Dear Boy

So bold and fine Iâve known you for some time. Whole life changed while Bones like yours and mine Go dance in the woods And down we go, down, down Oh, boy, youâre mine Do you remember old times? Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you Youâre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too Oh, dear boy, itâs so hollow without you In a world with everything but it won't do Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you Youâre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue It's our time for everything and I call you Sweet love of mine Destruction ain't a crime For those who find Love is a game like you and I Go dance in the waters Of all the tears we have cried Oh, boy, we're fine Do you remember our time? Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you Youâre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too Oh dear boy, itâs so hollow without you In a world with everything but it won't do Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you Youâre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue It's our time for everything and I call you

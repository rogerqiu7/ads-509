All You Need Is Love

I was low, Didn't believe in getting higher Didn't know, How easy it is to walk through the fire Oh You opened the stars in my heart. You let in the life from the dark. It's like the first time I realized that all you need is love. And I'm feeling, never letting go. Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe. Do you feel it, it's like the first time I realized that All You Need is Love. Yea I'm feeling, never letting go. Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe. Do you feel it, it's like the first time I realized that All You Need is Love.

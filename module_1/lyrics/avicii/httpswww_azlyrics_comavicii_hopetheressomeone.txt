Hope There's Someone

Hope there's someone Who'll take care of me When I die, will I go? And hope there's someone Who'll set my heart free Rest alone when I'm tired There's a ghost on the horizon When I go to bed How will I fall asleep tonight? How will I rest my head? And godsend I don't want to go To the seal's watershed And there's a ghost on the horizon When I go to bed Oh! Oh! ... Oh I'm scared of that middle place Between light and nowhere I don't want to be the one Left in there, left in there And there's a man on the horizon Wish that I'd go to bed And if I fall to his feet tonight Will allow rest my head And godsend I don't want to go To the seal's watershed And there's a ghost on the horizon When I go to bed...

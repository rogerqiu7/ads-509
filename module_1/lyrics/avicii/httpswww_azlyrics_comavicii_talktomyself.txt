Talk To Myself

Alone, I'm searching for devotion, in the faded melody My soul is trying to cross an ocean, down on bended knee Lock up my condense and rhyme, don't know what I'm trying to say (My heart) all the time was stolen, by bad poetry Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open, love's insanity So long words are left unspoken, couldn't set them free Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday (My heart) I'm left with a broken vocabulary Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

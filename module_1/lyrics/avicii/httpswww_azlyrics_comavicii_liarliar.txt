Liar Liar

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof? Follow you to dust Leavin' footprints on the clouds as we're walkin' home Iron hearts all turn to rust By tears and the daze on a diamond street Kiss these apocalypse Chasin' shadows, livin' dreams that don't exist Anymore We need to find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof? All closed and in your head Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone On a dark path in a rush Sky clears all the rain over everything Hear these apocalypse Where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse, forevermore We need to find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof? People talkin' but I can't hear them, no! I just sit there and watch them come and go There might be something underneath it all But at least I'll find what I'll find out in the end At least I'll find what I'll find out in the end

City Lights

City lights, take me away Now it's time, we never ever head down Don't be scared, I am for real Hide away and we will never be found It's alright, we never look back Birds will sing if we fall It's alright, with memories inside Midnight dust on the floor Watch it turn into gold And I don't even know what's real And I don't know what to feel I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies 'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down And I don't know what to feel No, I don't know what to feel See these lights, we're getting away Heads won't find us, we're not making a sound We're not scared, we are for real Love can't hurt us, now we're sheltered by lies It's alright, we never look back Birds will sing if we fall It's alright, with memories inside Midnight dust on the floor Watch it turn into gold And I don't even know what's real And I don't know what to feel I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies 'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down And I don't know what to feel No, I don't know what to feel

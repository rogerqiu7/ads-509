Always On The Run

Take me from the city Let's go for a drive Take me, Take me anywhere Just make me feel alive Make me feel this fire Higher than the sun Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Always on the run Always on the run Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Always on the run Always on the run Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh! On the run, on the run, run, run, run Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh! Things could be so easy but we're always on the run We could save our money We could buy a house Hit back on our patio Watching fireflies We could feel this fire Higher than the sun Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Always on the run Always on the run Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Always on the run Always on the run Things could be so easy But we're always on the run Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh! On the run, on the run, run, run, run Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh! Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
